# Intro

Hi this is Liu Zuojie(Jay). A pianist, a programmer and a teacher.

# About my name

You can also call me Jay as the pronouciation of my last chinese character(杰) which means great, big and heroic. Jay is not my ENGLISH NAME since a lot of non-asian people had asked me what my REAL CHINESE NAME is. I have to explain to them everytime with the following:

The first part of my name, Liu(刘 or 劉), is inherited from my father which is my family name. This name is the royal family name of the longest chinese empire, [Han Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty).

The second part my of name, Zuo(作), is the mark of generation. In traditional chinese naming system, a family will give the second character of their infants from their family genealogy poem, so the same generation from the same family will share the same second character. For instance, all of my father' s siblings have a second character as Sheng(胜 or 勝), and all of my siblings have a second charater as Zuo(作). Furthermore, all of my sons, daughters and my siblings' songs and daughters will have their second character as Pei(佩).

The last part of my name, called given name, is my real name. It came from a combination of Yin Yang and a famous poem written by a female peot [Li Qingzhao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qingzhao)(李清照). Here is the poem:

> 宋·李清照《绝句》
>
> 生当**作**人**杰**，死亦为鬼雄。
> 至今思项羽，不肯过江东。
>
> "Jue Ju" by Li Qingzhao from the Song Dynasty
>
> One ought to **live as a hero** in this world
> And after death a hero remain.
> The memory of Xiang Yu is cherished to this day
> Because he chose to die, not to cross the river, after his defeat.

# My history
